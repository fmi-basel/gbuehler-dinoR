}
\arguments{
\item{footprint_counts}{A Summarized Experiment containing the sample names (colData), ROI names (rowData),
and number of fragments in each NOMe footprint pattern category (assays). For example
the output of the footprintQuant function.}

\item{WTsamples}{The control sample names as they appear in footprint_quantifications.}

\item{KOsamples}{The treatment sample names as they appear in footprint_quantifications.}

\item{minreads}{The minimum number of fragments to which a footprint could be assigned
a ROI must have in all samples. All other ROIs are filtered out before the differential NOMe analysis.}

\item{prior.count}{The pseudocount used for edgeR::glmQLFit.}

\item{FDR}{The FDR cutoff for a ROI - footprint combination to be called regulated in the output.}

\item{FC}{The fold change cutoff for a ROI - footprint combination to be called regulated in the output.}

\item{combineNucCounts}{If TRUE, the upNuc, downNuc, and Nuc fragment counts will be combined into the Nuc category.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the results of differential fragment count testing for each ROI-footprint combination.
}
\description{
Tests for differential fragment counts for each NOMe
footprint pattern compared to all patterns in two conditions.
}
\details{
Uses edgeR's quasi-likelihood methods to conveniently test for differential proportions of each
one of 5 distinct footprints between at least two control and at least two treatment samples.
