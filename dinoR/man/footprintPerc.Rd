\usage{
footprintPerc(
  footprint_counts,
  minreads = 1,
  ROIgroup = "motif",
  combineNucCounts = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{footprint_counts}{A Summarized Experiment containing the sample names (colData), ROI names (rowData),
and number of fragments in each NOMe footprint pattern category (assays). For example
the output of the footprintQuant function.}

\item{minreads}{The minimum number of fragments to which a footprint could be assigned
a ROI must have in all samples. All other ROIs are filtered out before the differential NOMe analysis.}

\item{ROIgroup}{Column name of a metadata column in the rowData of the RSE,
describing a group each ROI belongs too, for example,
different transcription factor motifs at the center of the ROI.}

\item{combineNucCounts}{If TRUE, the upNuc, downNuc, and Nuc fragment counts will be combined into the Nuc category.}
}
\value{
A tibble where each column corresponds to a sample-footprint percentage and each row to a ROI.
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage of all reads in a ROI-sample combination in each footprint pattern.
}
\details{
Calculates the percentage of all reads in a ROI-sample combination in each footprint pattern. Then turns
the table into wide format, where each column corresponds to a sample-footprint percentage and each row to a ROI
and clusters the rows by similarity.
