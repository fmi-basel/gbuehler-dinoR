\arguments{
\item{NomeData}{A Ranged Summarized Experiment (RSE) with an entry for each ROI. The (\code{rowData}) should contain information about each ROI,
including a ROIgroup.The (\code{assays}) should contain at least (\code{nFragsAnalyzed}) and (\code{reads}). (\code{nFragsAnalyzed}) describes the number of fragments
that were analyzed for each sample/ROI combination. (\code{reads}) contains a Gpos object for each sample/ROI combination,
with a position for each base in the ROI and two metadata columns (protection and methylation). protection is a sparse logical matrix where
TRUE stands for Cs protected from methylation, and methylation is a sparse logical matrix where TRUE stands for methylated Cs.}

\item{window_1}{Integer vector with two elements representing start and end positions
of the first window relative to the ROI center.}

\item{window_2}{Integer vector with two elements representing start and end positions
of the second window relative to the ROI center.}

\item{window_3}{Integer vector with two elements representing start and end positions
of the third window relative to the ROI center.}
}
\value{
The Ranged Summarized Experiment with an assay "footprints" added, which contains a footprint type assigned to each fragment.
}
\description{
Assign a footprint type to each fragment based on GCH protection values in pre-defined windows.
}
\details{
Selects 3 windows (default is -50:-25, -8:8, 25:50) around the center of the provided region of interest (ROI) and calculates the average GCH
methylation protection for a given fragment across all GCHs in each window.
If it is above 0.5 the window is deemed protected, below 0.5, unprotected. Depending on the protection pattern
in all windows, a read is put into one of 5 footprint categories: tf bound (0 - 1 - 0), open chromatin (0 - 0 - 0),
downstream positioned nucleosome (1 - 1 - 0), other nucleosome (1 - 1 - 1, 1 - 0 - 0, 0 - 0 - 1, 1 - 0 - 1), and upstream positioned nucleosome (0 - 1 - 1).
