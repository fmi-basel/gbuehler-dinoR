Description: dinoR can test for significant differences in NOME-seq
    footprints between two conditions, 
    using genomic regions of interested centered around a landmark, 
    for example a transcription factor motif. 
    This package takes as input NOMe-seq  data in the form of a GCH protection matrix,
    where every row is a fragment and every column a position relative to the region landmark.
    dinoR can be used to group the fragments into 5 categories representing characteristic footprints,
    plot the percentage of fragments in each category in a heatmap, or averaged across different ROI 
    groups, for example, containing a common TF motif. It is especially designed
    to compare footprints between two sample groups, using edgeR's quasi-likelihood methods on the total
    fragment counts per ROI, sample, and footprint category, as well as the percentage of fragment counts.
