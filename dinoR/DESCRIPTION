Description: dinoR tests for significant differences in NOMe-seq
    footprints between two conditions, 
    using genomic regions of interest (ROI) centered around a landmark, 
    for example a transcription factor (TF) motif. 
    This package takes NOMe-seq data (GCH methylation/protection) in the form of a Ranged Summarized Experiment as  input. 
    dinoR can be used to group sequencing fragments into 3 or 5 categories representing characteristic footprints (TF bound, nculeosome bound, open chromatin),
    plot the percentage of fragments in each category in a heatmap, or averaged across different ROI 
    groups, for example, containing a common TF motif. It is designed
    to compare footprints between two sample groups, using edgeR's quasi-likelihood methods on the total
    fragment counts per ROI, sample, and footprint category.
